# Sustainability Dashboard

A modern sustainability dashboard built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**, allowing users to upload CSV datasets, preview data, sort/filter tables, and visualize metrics with interactive charts.

## Features

- Upload and preview CSV files (first 10 rows)
- Interactive, sortable, and filterable data table
- Data visualization with charts (using Chart.js)
- Styled with Tailwind CSS (v4)
- Fully responsive layout
- Error handling for file formats and upload feedback

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family by Vercel.
